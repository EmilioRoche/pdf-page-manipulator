Helps 'delete' page(s) on a pdf

I use an external website (Resumake.io) to help create my resumes. I like to have to my resume on a single page, but this particular website likes to add a blank page at end of the pdf file that is generated for some reason. So instead of going to a website and watch an ad to delete my pdf, I created this pdf page deleter in Python for everytime I create a new resume pdf.
